This project revolves around analyzing and predicting CO2 emissions from a
dataset containing detailed information about various car models. Beginning with
data preprocessing, the dataset undergoes cleaning and exploration to ensure its
integrity and understand its structure. Through exploratory data analysis, insights
into the distribution of key variables such as car makes, models, engine sizes, and
fuel types are gained through visualizations like bar plots and distribution plots.
A crucial aspect of the project involves comparing the predictions from each model
to the actual CO2 emissions, assessing their accuracy and reliability. This
comparison provides insights into which model performs best in predicting CO2
emissions based on the given dataset. Finally, the results are presented visually,
with a table generated using Plotly showcasing predicted values from different
models alongside their comparison with actual values. This comprehensive
analysis not only sheds light on factors influencing CO2 emissions but also
furnishes a practical predictive model for estimating emissions based on vehicle
characteristics
